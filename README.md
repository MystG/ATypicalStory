# ATypicalStory
A game I, Liliana Campuzano, made in Construct 2 for my Game Design class. I couldn't finish it because I ran out of space to code in the trial version. What sucks most is that it's buggy and unless I find the time to actually rearrange some code and see what can be removed, it's going to have to stay that way.

All the art, code, and story is mine. The sound effects are mine but the main song is bought.

The biggest bugs are:
1) the fact that after the first death, your shooting arm stays where you last died. It's a quick fix, but like I said before, code needs to possibly be rearranged in order to fix it.
2) The monsters don't reset after respawning which leads to you dying constantly when you respawn at a checkpoint, especially if that's near where you died last because that's where the monsters will still be when you respawn.
3) There is nothing after you reach the end. Just more story which seems disconnected with the game.

2 & 3 were going to be fixed when I ran out of space. Now I'm thinking of just taking this over to Unity and remaking it there. It sounds like it could be cool in 3D. 

# Game Overview
Most of this is explained in the game anyway, but here it is:
This game has been exported to HTML5. Working on getting this on Unity or a website so it can be playable.
The story was made longer in this readme... More detailed.

# Story
Your name is Gary. You are the best friend of a girl you really like, but you're afraid of telling her because, like any teenager, you're afraid of rejection. 
Cynthia, the girl, likes Gary, but he doesn't know that, and she doesn't know that he likes her.
One day, Gary decides that he is going to go on this adventure that he's been preparing for these past few months. He goes over to Cynthia's house to tell her. To his surprise, she wanted to join him since she didn't want to be separated from him for who knows how long.
Gary, concerned for her safety and afraid something may happen to her along the way, tells her "No" when she sks if she can come along.
Cynthia, feeling rejected, upset, and scared she'll never see him again, runs back into her house, crying, and locks herself in her room.
Upon deciding to walk away to giver her some space, something mysterious sucks Gary into the house. The next thing he knows, he's surrounded by darkness and something ominous looms beyond the dark.

Cynthia slammed the door to her room and went into bed to cry into her pillow. Felix, her BFF, looks up from his meeting with the other ghosts. Felix knew she was going to meet that good-for-nothing Gary, so this crying, upset behavior must be his fault!
Enraged at his precious friend getting hurt, he leaves the room and pulls Gary in before he even thinks about walking away. 
Hernance, Slich, Winto, and Nehrdu (friends of Cynthia and Felix, their "leader") follow swiftly after Felix and duplicate themselves in order to get back at that terrible guy. 

Now, Gary must make it through the halls to get to Cynthia's door to explain things and, hopefully confess. After all, there is no going back, literally. Felix made the door to the outside disappear.

# Controls
Arrow keys to go left, right, jump (space, too). Point and click to shoot. Not recommended for trackpad.
With all these monsters coming at him, and with only his trusty lazer gun, can he make it to the door?
